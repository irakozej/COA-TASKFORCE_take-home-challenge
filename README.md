## This Repository contains two major projects:
* Animals Gallery and 
* The Challenges

## Animals Gallery.
This is a simple reponsive animal gallery that represents animals and
some information about them.

### The Challenges.
In this part of the project, we have two challenges:
*- Array Manipulation and
*- The String Transformation

### Array manipulation.
In this challenge, we take an array and check it consists of a subarray that sums up to the speciefied target.
If there is: we return TRUE, otherwise we return FALSE.

*String Transformation.*
In this challenge,
- If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
- If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
- If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15), perform both operations in the order specified above.


## How to run these challenges:
- Clone this repository.
- Install the necessary tools to run and interact with HTML, CSS and javascript.
